# Titanic-Machine-learning-from-Disaster
Kaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one I did first is about predicting which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.

In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not.
